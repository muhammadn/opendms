/**
 * Store-and-forward outbox job for hybrid field/cloud deployment.
 *
 * This job is ONLY dispatched when CENTRAL_DMS_URL is configured in the
 * environment, i.e. in hybrid deployment mode. In production mode (where
 * this application IS the central server) and in fully offline standalone
 * mode, this job is never dispatched and these columns remain null.
 *
 * Retry behaviour:
 *   - Up to 999 attempts so records accumulated during multi-day outages
 *     are all eventually delivered without operator intervention.
 *   - Exponential backoff: 30s → 60s → 2min → 5min → 10min.
 *   - On success the record's `synced` flag is set to true and `synced_at`
 *     is recorded for audit purposes.
